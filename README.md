### Design Choices

I chose to design the NYC Wifi Finder in a minimalist manner. I believe pieces of technology like this are usually accessed briefly by users for a very specific purpose. Creating a low amount of visual distraction between the user and task is useful in this case. Minimalist style choices were employed in this design with inspiration from Google’s material design and modernism. This can be seen from the predominantly flat UI. The color choice of black and white with a sans serif font was also inspired from aspects of modernism.

### Frameworks and Libraries

If given the choice to use frameworks and libraries to accomplish this task, I’d use the following: Node, React, Redux, Webpack, SCSS, CSS Module, Bootstrap's Reboot, Jest, and Enzyme. I would choose this stack of technologies because I am much more familiar manipulating a virtual DOM with React than I am using native javascript methods to alter HTML. Also I enjoy creating products that have the ability to easily grow and be tested with varying features. With the technologies I’ve listed, I’m confident I could accomplish such a goal.
